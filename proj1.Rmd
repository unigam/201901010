# **1. Research Question and Background** 

With the recent surge in the number of mass shootings and other serious criminal activities in different establishments and institutions across the United States, it has become a concern for policymakers and law enforcement officials alike, to take steps in order to curb crimes. Across the USA, from 2010 until 2018, the K12 mass shootings increased from 15 to 110 as can be seen below. (data by CHDS)

These crimes have serious implications on the safety of students and staff at schools where these factors might affect the quality of learning and overall educational attainment. 

The primary purpose of this paper is to examine as to what extent do factors other than security measures undertaken by the school and law enforcement affect crimes of varying degrees in schools. Previous work done by researchers (Jennings et al.2011), have examined relationships between school security facilities and crimes; concluding that increase in deployment of recognizable law enforcement officials and metal detectors reduced violent crimes while increased possession of firearms by police was statistically associated with higher violent criminal activities. This paper would expand on such research by examining if certain school characteristics like race (percentage of whites and non-white people enrolled), the level of education (primary, high school, middle school or combined), school size with respect to total enrollment, location of the school (whether in a city, suburban area, town or a rural area) affect the number of crimes both violent (indicated by actions such as shootings, attacks, murders, etc.) and non-violent (possession of weapons, drugs, etc.). 

This study can be viewed as a humbly attempted extension of the previous work done by economists and researchers on addressing K12 crime issues, while helping legislators and law enforcements alike to take steps to address them hence ensuring a safe environment for learning and growth for students all over the US.

# **2. Dataset and Data description** 
 
The dataset comes from the SSOC 2010 survey on the crime statistics in K-12 schools across the USA. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire mailed to schools (primary, secondary, high, combined) and telephone follow-ups of school principal officials. Missing values have been imputed. The sample has responses from 2648 schools with a larger proportion of middle and high schools based on the idea (according to data by NCS) that most of the crimes have been reported from middle and high schools. 

## 2.1  Variables under study

In order to extract variables of interest for our study, one needs to read through and interpret variable history and descriptions from the adjoining codebook which can be found at https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2015/2015061.pdf

Composite variables have been created as a combination of relevant variables as found in the dataset so as to aid the researcher in carrying analysis without having to create additional data frames as a summation of variables of interest. In order to prevent this section being unnecessarily long, the summaries of our response variables have been provided below (individual code descriptions can be found in the codebook). 

### *2.1.1  Dependent/Response Variables* 

1. VIOINC10 <- Total number of violent incidents recorded by the school. 
These incidents include activities involving a weapon or otherwise like homicides, murder, robbery, threats of attacks, rape. 
VIOINC10 - sum(C0310, C0314, C0318, C0322, C0326, C0330, C0334, C0338)

2. VIOPOL10 <- Total number of violent crime incidents reported to the police or relevant law enforcement. 
From intuition, this number ought to be less than VIOINC08, else we might need to account for incidents which might be reported to police straight away rather than taking recourse to school officials suggesting a higher degree of damage or threat. Let's have a look at the result from the code chunk below :
VIOPOL10 - sum(C0312, C0316, C0320, C0324, C0328, C0332, C0336, C0340)

```{r}
#load dataset from Github; raw link
library(haven)
dat <- read_sas("https://github.com/unigam/201901010/blob/master/backup/pu_ssocs10_sas.sas7bdat?raw=true", 
NULL)
#check if sum of VIOPOL08 > sum of VIOINV08
sum(dat$VIOPOL10)>sum(dat$VIOINC10)
```

The statement returns "FALSE" which confirms our intuition is correct.

3. GANGHATE10 <- Total number of hate crimes and gang related crimes 
GANGHATE10 - sum(C0366, C0368, C0369)


### *2.1.2  Independent Variables* 

These variables answer - 'to what extent are the dependent variables in our study depend on these independent variables'

1. PERCWHT = This is a SSOCS-created variable representing Percent White enrollment as reported in the 2007–08 CCD school data file. This variable has four categories. 1 = more than 95 percent, 2 = more than 80 to 95 percent, 3 = more than 50 to 80 percent, and 4 = 50 percent or less. (Categorical)

2. FR_LVEL = School grades offered as reported in the 2005–06 CCD school data file. This variable has four categories indicating the span of grades offered. 1=primary, 2=middle, 3=high school, and 4=combined. (Categorical) 

3. FR_SIZE = Size categories. This variable collapses the number of students into four categories: 1=less than 300; 2=300–499; 3=500–999; and 4=1,000 or more. (Categorical) 

4. FR_URBAN = This variable collapses the 12-level locale variable on the SSOCS:2008 restricted-use file into four categories: city (FR_LOC12/R=11, 12, or 13), suburb (FR_LOC12/R=21, 22, or 23), town (FR_LOC12/R=31, 32, or 33), and rural (FR_LOC12/R=41, 42, or 43). (Categorical) 

### *2.1.2.1  We can summarise the various independent variables as below to see their distribution across categories*

1. Number of schools by percentage of white students enrolled

```{r}
#barplot showing number of schools by % of white enrollment 
counts <- table(dat$PERCWHT)
barplot(counts, main="Schools by % White Enrollment",
  names.arg=c(">95%", ">80% till 95%", ">50% till 80%","50% or less"))
```
2. Number of schools by grade levels

```{r}
#barplot showing number of schools by grade levels offered 
counts <- table(dat$FR_LVEL)
barplot(counts, main="Schools by Grade Levels",
  names.arg=c("Primary", "Middle", "High School","Combined"))
```

3. Number of schools by enrollment size

```{r}
#barplot showing number of schools by enrollment size
counts <- table(dat$FR_SIZE)
barplot(counts, main="Schools by Enrollment Size",
  names.arg=c("less than 300", "300-499", "500-999","1000 or more"))
```

4. Number of schools by location

```{r}
#barplot showing number of schools by location
counts <- table(dat$FR_URBAN)
barplot(counts, main="Schools by Location",
  names.arg=c("City", "Suburban", "Town","Rural"))
```

# **3.  Empirical Model **

The dependent variables considered in this draft are discreet in nature. However the independent variables are both discreet and ordinal categorical variables. 

One can employ simple linear and/or multiple linear regressions. Pearson's correlation might not give meaningful results for descriptive statistics owing to categorical variables so one could employ one-way ANOVA to study if mean values are equal for a dependent variable across different categories of our independent categorical variable.

Let's consider if the number of hate/gang related crimes have equal mean values across different levels of percentage of white people enrolled (cat. 1-4 as described in section 2.1.2 ) 

```{r}
#convert PERCWHT to factor(perwht)
perwht <- factor(dat$PERCWHT)
#carry out one-way ANOVA between total number of hate crimes and gang related crimes and categories of perwht
summary(aov(dat$GANGHATE~perwht)) 
```
Since the results are significant (>95% C.I), we might run a regression to estimate how change in perwht across categories affect GANGHATE. 

```{r}
#Results of a SLR between GANGHATE and perwht
summary(lm(formula = GANGHATE~perwht, data = dat)) 
```

It seems from the results that schools with lower percentage of white enrollment witness a greater number of gang/hate crimes as the results seem to be statistically significant. 

A multiple regression between GANGHATE and factors of PERCWHT, FR_LVEL, FR_SIZE, FR_URBAN to check the partial effects of each on total gang and hate related crimes.

```{r}
#Converting into factors
frlvel <- factor(dat$FR_LVEL)
frsize <- factor(dat$FR_SIZE)
frurban <- factor(dat$FR_URBAN)
#Results of the regression
summary(lm(formula = GANGHATE~perwht+frlvel+frsize+frurban, data = dat))
```

What could be even more interesting to compare is how the estimates change when GANGHATE is regressed on these independent variables individually. As we notice, the partial effects of categories across perwht are statistically relatively less when compared to their SLR counterpart. 

As seen in the MLR and as expected by the data collection officials when sampling this dataset, the higher incidences of gang related crimes are in middle and high school (larger coefficients of frlvel2 and frlvel3). Let's run a SLR to examine what the intercept is and how the effects compare against a MLR regression. 

```{r}
#Results of a SLR between GANGHATE and frlvel
summary(lm(formula = GANGHATE~frlvel, data = dat)) 
```

It seems high schools report a significantly highest level of crime among all categories. This confirms the earlier assumption
